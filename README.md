## Overview

Using FEM to improve my foundations of HTML, CSS and JS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### Learning Points

Some learning points I have from doing the challenge:

1. Give better thoughts to reusable css classes
    - Recognise resused patterns for both Web and Mobile
    - Create Utility classes

2. Use utility classes for html elements, instead of creating unique classes to style them

Might or might not work on these learning points. :-)
